# Machine Learning & Statistics Project Assessment

Project assessment based on analysing the Boston Housing Dataset using descriptive and inferential statistics and completing with creating a keras neural network to predict the meadian house price for test data sets.

## Contents of the repository -

This repository contains a notebook, notebook under the name "Overall" within the repository, which is used to completing the below mention objectives outlined in the project description :

1. Describe
    - Use descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston Housing dataset.
    
2. Infer
    - Use inferential staticstics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in the median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that are not. Discuss and explain the findings.
    
3. Predict
    - User keras to create a neural network that can predict the meadian house price based on the other variables available.

## How to run the notebook -

To run, edit and view this notebook the download option can be used on the dashboard view for this repository. This will download a zip file containing the notebook, Overall, and files related to this assignment. 

In order to use this notebook it is required to have the correct packages installed which allow jupyter notebook to be utilised on the machine being used to view this file. The most popular way to install this, and multiple other useful packages, is through the use of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). *[1]*

Once the relevant file has been downloaded locally to your machine, and you have installed the packages required to utilise jupyter notebooks, the command jupyter notebook can be ran through any command line interface which you may have installed. This can be ran from your home folder or by using the "cd" command to the folder in which you have downloaded the notebooks files. This will lead to a pop up window of Jupyter notebook to be opened and a list of files in the folder you have ran this command from should appear. Following this you will need to locate the notebook file on your machine using the file structure in Jupyter notebook.

Once the file has been opened the Cell, run all, commands can be used to re-run any code cells to view the results etc. The various functions which can be used in the jupyter notebooks to view, edit and run the cells, text or code, can be found on their website [here](http://jupyter.org/) or through the various cheat sheets available online. *[2]*
